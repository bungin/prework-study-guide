          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing
            tag represented with angle brackets (< >)</li>
          <li>&lt;ele&gt; &lt;/ele&gt; closing tag</li><br>
          <li>The &lt;br&gt; element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, 
            between two blocks of content.</li>
            <br>
          <li>COMMENT OUT: &lt;!-- --&gt; </li><br>
          <li>The &lt;head&gt; element contains information, or metadata, that helps 
            the browser to render the page correctly. Elements
            included within the head> are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li><br>
            <br>
            <li>The &lt;body&gt; element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements 
              that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
            <br>
          <li>HTML ELEMENTS:<br>
            The &lt;style&gt; element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.
            <br>
            The &lt;base&gt; element defines the base URL for a webpage.
            <br>
            The &lt;link&gt; element connects an external resource to the HTML document.
            <br>
            The &lt;meta&gt; element defines metadata such as the character set, description, 
                keywords, author, and viewport.<br></li>
                <br>
            <li>IMAGE: 
              <br>img example:
              &lt;img
                  src=https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/prework/module-03/lesson-01/cute-pandas-02.jpg"

                  height=346
                /&gt;
                <br>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that 
                  describes the appearance and functionality of the image
                  The alt text is important for screen readers and other
                  assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve 
                  search engine rankings for your website.</li><br>
            <li>HEADER: &lt;h1-6 (font sizes?) /h&gt;</li><br>
            <li>LIST:&lt;ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt;<br>
            The &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; elements represent: <br> 
              unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
            <br>
            <li>META-RELATED</li>

            <br>
            <li>&lt;p&gt; paragraph &lt;/p&gt;</li>
            <br>
            <li>hyperlink: the &lt;a&gt; element (which stands for anchor) creates links 
                to the same webpage or other webpages. <br>
                The href attribute points to the URL for the link: <br>
                &lt;a&gt; href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda">More About Giant Pandas &lt;/a&gt;</li>
            <br>

            <li>&lt;DOCTYPE&gt; is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration.
                Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
            <br>
            <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, 
              never the closing element.</li>
            <br>
            <li>the &lt;title&gt; element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required 
              and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
            <br>
            </li>
            <li>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css"&gt;<br>
              &lt;link&gt; element creates the connection to the external file.<br>
             &lt;rel&gt; attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked 
              document resource.<br>
              &lt;href&gt; attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.<br>
              The &lt;href&gt; attribute is using a relative path.<br>
              This means the location is derived from the current location (in this case, index.html).<br>
              To locate the style sheet from the current location, we must look in the assets folder, 
              hence assets/style.css.<br><br>
              <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li><br>

        <ls>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.

        <ls>The feature/starter-code is the name of the new branch.<br>We have added the prefix,

        <ls>The feature/starter-code is the name of the new branch.<br>We have added the prefix, 

          feature, to indicate that it is a feature.<br>It is good practice to name the

          purpose of each branch.</ls>

          <ls>CSS = Cascading Style Sheets</ls>

            <ls>inline CSS</ls><br>

            &lt;h1 style="color:red;">Prework Study Guide&lt;/h1><br>

            <ls>a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</ls><br><br>

          <ls>The following code shows what an internal CSS style sheet looks like:</ls><br>
            &lt;head><br>
            &lt;style><br>
              h1 {<br>

              }<br>
              &lt;/style><br>
              &lt;/head><br>
              <br>
            <ls>The preceding CSS states that all &lt;h1> elements on the webpage will be red.</ls><br><br>

            <ls>external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows 
            developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</ls><br><br>

            <ls>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a &lt;link> element placed in the HTML's &lt;head>,
            as shown in the following code:</ls><br>
            &lt;head>
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" />
            &lt;/head>
            <br><br>
            <ls>Separation of concerns</ls><br><br>

          <ls>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</ls><br><br>

          <ls>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element</ls><br><br>

          <ls>When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the 
            padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer 
            outside an element.</ls><br>

            <ls>CSS box model: 310-box-model.png</ls><br>

            <ls>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. 
            To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *<br>
            * {<br>
                margin: 0;<br>
                padding: 0;<br>
            }<br></ls>

                color: white;<br>
            }</ls><br><br>

          <ls>Notice that in the preceding rule, we combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma,
            allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</ls><br><br>

            }<br><br>
          </ls>
          <ls>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector.<br>
            Any HTML element assigned to the class,
            card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</ls><br>
            <br>
          <ls>The first declaration addresses the width of the element at 80% of the available width.</ls><br>
          <br>
          <ls>The margin property assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.</ls><br>
          <br>
          <ls>The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.</ls><br>
          <br>
